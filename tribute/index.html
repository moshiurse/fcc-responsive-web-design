User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main",
 which contains all other elements.

User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", 
which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject
 of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a 
corresponding id="image".

User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a
 corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content
  describing the image shown in img-div.

User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info",
 which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link",
 which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the 
 subject of the tribute page. 
 HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order
  for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize,
 relative to the width of its parent element, 
 without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element
